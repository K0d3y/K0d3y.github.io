        Prepare your tools and materials such as a hammer, tongs and high carbon or damascus steel. 
        You can either forge weld your own pattern welded steel, or buy your own. 
        After you have gathered the materials, you can start to plan out the design of your sword. 
        Starting with a simple design is usually the best way to master the fundamentals. 
        Research traditional swords from history to gather inspiration and draw out your design on paper. 
      </div>
      <div id="Forge2" class="ForgeText TextItem">
        Start your project with stock steel that is roughly the length of your final design. 
        Grip the steel with a pair of tongs and heat it in a forge until the color of the steel turns yellow. 
        Once it has reached temperature, remove your steel from the forge. 
        Set the stock flat on your anvil and shape the corner into the shape of a sword using a hammer. 
        Make sure to taper both sides of the steel evenly. 
      </div>
      <div id="Forge3" class="ForgeText TextItem">
        Bevel the edges of your steel with a hammer to create a cutting edge on either side of the sword. 
        Once you have hammered one side, flip the sword on the anvil and hammer the other side until both are even. 
        Once you have the shape of your sword established, reheat it to normalize the steel. 
        Grip the steel with your tongs and bring it up to non-magnetic temperature. 
        Let it cool off at room temperature. 
      </div>
      <div id="Forge4" class="ForgeText TextItem">
        Once all the red color has left the steel, place it back in the forge and repeat this process three times. 
        Sand the sword to smooth out the edges on a belt sander or by hand. 
        Once the sword has been beveled, normalized, and sanded, reheat it and dip it in oil until it reaches room temperature. 
        This process is known as quenching and it hardens the steel to strengthen your sword. 
        Make sure you transfer the blade from the fire to the quenching as quickly as possible. 
        If you are too slow, the sword blade will not harden properly. 
        Slowly reheat your quenched sword in a forge to a lower temperature. 
        This will relax the brittleness and stress induced by the quenching process. 
      </div>
      <div id="Forge5" class="ForgeText TextItem">
        The hilt is another word for a sword handle. 
        It is usually made from leather, wire, or wood, and is fastened to the blade to provide ease while holding the sword. 
        The pommel is a large fitting at the top of the hilt, and is usually made of metal. 
        It ensures that the sword will not slip out of your hand, and also provides a weighted equilibrium. 
        With a fine file and whetstone carefully sharpen your sword blade until you are satisfied.

    <!--history of swords-->
    <div class="page" id="page3">
      <div id="History1" class="HistoryText TextItem">
        Pattern welded steel swords date back to the first millennium B.C., with Celtic, African, Germanic, and Roman swords first exhibiting the method. 
        Layered Damascus steel, which is a form of pattern welding, was also used in South Asia, and the Middle East during the Middle Ages. 
      </div>
      <div id="History2" class="HistoryText TextItem">
        Chinese swordsmiths are credited with creating the technology that made its way to Korea and Japan, where swordsmiths developed innovative techniques and new weapons such as the katana. 
        Between 1185-1333 A.D., Japan was under military rule. 
      </div>
      <div id="History3" class="HistoryText TextItem">
        This became known as the "Golden era" of Japanese bladesmithing, as they became quick to develop new technology and mastery around swordsmithing out of the necessity of defense. 
        With the Industrial Revolution came the development of advanced machines and swordsmithing technology. 
      </div>
      <div id="History4" class="HistoryText TextItem">
        Traditional smithing methods became less common until resurging fairly recently. 
        By the mid 20th century, bladesmithing had become a niche industry, kept alive by a small pool of bladesmiths. 
      </div>
      <div id="History5" class="HistoryText TextItem">
        In the 1960s, bladesmith William Moran began to revive the ancient pattern welding process of forging Damascus steel. 
        While the exact traditional methods were not recorded, Moran managed to teach himself the process and published a free booklet detailing the process. 
      </div>
      <div id="History6" class="HistoryText TextItem">
        Ultimately, Moran made the swordsmithing process accessible to anyone who wanted to learn. 
        He founded the American Bladesmith Society in 1976, further expanding the network and resources of both professional and hobbyist bladesmiths.
